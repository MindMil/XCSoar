XCSoar Python API for SkyLines
==============================

Compile with

 make python

and copy the library file ('py_xcsoar.so') to your desired location
as 'xcsoar.so'.


Short API description
---------------------

* class xcsoar.Flight(file=igcfile, [keep])

Initializes the API with the igcfile. The file won't be
loaded into memory unless you set keep == True.


The class Flight supports the following methods:


* Flight.path([begin], [end])

Returns a list of tuples with flight fixes. If
begin or end are set to a DateTime object, the
output is limited to those times.


* Flight.google_encoded([begin], [end], [num_levels], [zoom_factor],
                        [max_delta_time], [threshold], [force_endpoints])

Returns a dict with google encoded fixes, times, height and enl values.
Begin and end limits the output to the given time range.
The options num_levels, zoom_factor and threshold control the level
of detail for each zoom level of the douglas peucker algorithm.
To get uniform distributed points set max_delta_time to a reasonable
value. Setting force_endpoints to True forces the endpoints to be
at the highest level.


* Flight.times()

Returns a list of detected takeoff/release/landing times found in the flight.


* Flight.analyse([begin], [end], [full], [triangle], [sprint])

Analyse a flight with the scoring window from begin to end (both DateTime
objects), optional specifying the number of trace points for the optimiser.


* encode_points(points)

Direct access to the google encoding for geopoints. Pass a list of tuples
with (latitude, longitude), both in degree.


* encode_list(list)

Encodes a list of int with the google encoding algorithm.
